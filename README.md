This project will allow an audience to see their favourite streamer's Twitch events in real-time.

I'm providing a Dockerized version of this project using Python, Django and Django Channels to implement 
websockets.

To run this project you will need to Install Docker and use the following command in the directory's root:

docker-compose up
